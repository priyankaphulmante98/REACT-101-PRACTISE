# Problem

## Description

- [Video Explainer](https://masai-course.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/material/videos/35157/9DizeCI7zGJwbu4jdPxHTS4gtSgKNqA8ljbRnZkI.mp4)

You have 3 files

- **Heading.jsx**

You need to create a component called Heading. This component will need to have an h1 tag, and have its text content as Masai School

- **Image.jsx**

You need to create an Image component which accepts the following properties / props

- title
- src
- alt
- width
- height
  You need to pass the title to an h2 tag.  
  You need to create an image tag, which has the width, height, image source, and the alternate text passed to the image element

- **PlayPause.jsx**

Create a component called PlayPause.  
The component should have two elements, an h1 tag and another button element.  
The h1 tag should have the title **The state is paused** by default. There should be a button, which has the text **paused**.  
Heading 1 - **The state is paused**  
Button text - **paused**

When you **click** on the button, then the state should change, and the h1 tag should now change to  
Heading 1 - **The state is playing**  
Button text - **playing**
